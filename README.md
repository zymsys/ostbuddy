ostbuddy
========

osTicket Buddy runs alongside osTicket. In its initial release it provides a public list of all tickets with their names and numbers. This may violate your own security policy, so please be careful.

I'll be adding to it as dictated by my own needs.

It accesses osTicket's database directly, so it can bypass osTicket's security model, destroy your data, and might eat your cat. Use at your own risk.
